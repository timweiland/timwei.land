Hey there! My name is Tim and I am currently a master's student in Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen in Germany. I'm very fond of neat mathematics and clever algorithms and like using these to solve problems.

I organize hackathons and other tech events through [[https://hackundsoehne.de][Hack & Söhne]] to spread the hacking spirit in Germany.

Feel free to contact me [[mailto:hello@timwei.land][via mail]] or any means of communication of your choice listed on the front page. For more detailed information about me, please take a look at [[/cv.pdf][my CV]].
